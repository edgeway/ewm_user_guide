# EdgeWay Management Overview
**EdgeWay Management** is a web application that helps configure the IoT infrastructure of the company including [EdgeWay devices](#device), [physical](#pcam) and [virtual](#vcam) cameras. **EdgeWay Management** is a part of the **EdgeWay Platform**.

**EdgeWay Management** helps users perform the following groups of procedures:

  - onboard, manage, organize and unplug [EdgeWay Node](#ewnode) devices,
  - review associated [physical cameras](#pcam),
  - get an overview of the devices and cameras working status,
  - review notifications from devices and cameras,
  - work with organization profile, manage users of **EdgeWay Management**, adjust their access rights.

**EdgeWay Management** offers a convenient way to perform operations depending on a role performed by a user:

  - **Administrator**, to work with EdgeWay devices and cameras, to manage users and their access to the application, 
  - **Viewer**, to overview the IoT structure without the access to change it.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Log in Screen
Before a user can start working with **EdgeWay Management**, they must authorize (see [fig. 1](#fig1)). Initially, a tenant administrator receives their credentials during the [tenant](#tenant) [signing up procedure](#signing-up). Afterward, a tenant administrator may create more users and assign access rights to them (See [Managing Users and Access](#managing-users-and-access)).

Authorization credentials include login name and password. Also, a user may select a signing in option via the AUTH0 mechanism, for example, using their Google account. 

<a name="signing-up"></a>If a user is new to **EdgeWay Management**, they may sign up by clicking the _Sign up here_ link below the login form, or continue logging in with the existing AUTH0-account: the application will understand that the user needs to be registered. During the signing up procedure, a user will be requested to enter the first [device](#ewnode) [UUID](#UUID) to control it via the user's account. This UUID is provided with the device (the sticker on the bottom of the device).

A user may select the option _Stay logged in_ that lets **EdgeWay Management** remember the credentials for 30 days and simplify further access to the application.

## Main Screen and Dashboard

### Main Screen
After authorization, a user comes to the main screen of the application that includes the top panel, left menu panel, and central part.

In the top panel, among the logo and application title, a user can see links to _Documentation_ and _SIEM Dashboard_ along with the basic information about devices: number of active devices available to overview and manage. 

An icon ![](./assets/icons/refresh.png) (_Refresh_) leads to the [Deployments](#deployments) section where the tenant administrator may apply a firmware artifact to the devices.

_SIEM Dashboard_ link leads to the [SIEM](#SIEM) system's dashboard where the user may see the logged messages from the **EdgeWay Platform**.

A user role and login name information are visible in the right part of the top panel. The _User menu_ gives access to the [settings](#settings) of the account and organization and the user management.

_<a name="fig2"></a>Figure 2. EdgeWay Management main screen_

![Main](./assets/screenshots/dashboard2.png)

On the left, in the menu panel, a user can see every action group available in the application (see chapters [below](#devices)).

### Dashboard
The Dashboard displays basic indicators of the [IoT infrastructure](#iot):

- **Active alarms**, a pie diagram showing how many alarms for devices are raised at the moment, see more in the chapter [Device Alarms&Actions Group](#device-alarmsactions-group).
- **Heartbeat summary**, a pie diagram showing the ping status of plugged devices: active or seen recently, not seen over 1 day, etc. 
- **Artifacts summary**, a pie diagram showing the device firmware version distribution. 

In the _Camera Statistics_ section, a user can see the distribution of cameras over the vendors and models.

In the _Devices_ section, there are simple statistics of the plugged devices (controlled via the **EdgeWay Management** interface).

In the _Deployments_ section, a user can see the firmware deployments by status: pending and in progress.

## Devices
The Devices section allows users to see the full list of EdgeWay devices, filter it by status and UUID, sort by characteristics, and organize plugged devices in groups ([see fig.3](#fig3)).

_<a name="fig3"></a>Figure 3. EdgeWay Management Devices screen_

![Devices](./assets/screenshots/devices.png)

###Groups
All devices may be organized in groups. Initially, there are no groups, and just two predefined pseudo-groups are available: _All devices_ group lets a user see the full list of devices, _Ungrouped_ helps find devices not belonging to any group.

Groups may be created by clicking _Create a group_ link. Each group must contain at least one device, each device may belong to not more than one group ([see fig.4](#fig4)). If a user associates a device with some group, it will be removed from the other group.

_<a name="fig4"></a>Figure 4. New group dialog_

![NewGroup](./assets/screenshots/newgroup.png)

By clicking the group name in the left panel, a user can switch to the list of devices belonging to the group. All manually created groups may be removed by entering the group and clicking the ![](./assets/icons/remove.png)_REMOVE GROUP_ link ([see fig.5](#fig5)). After group deletion, all devices from the group become ungrouped.

_<a name="fig5"></a>Figure 5. Group contents_

![Group](./assets/screenshots/group.png)

A device (or devices) may be added to a group by selecting them in the list of devices and clicking the button _MOVE SELECTED DEVICE TO ANOTHER GROUP_ in the bottom right corner of the screen ([see fig. 6](#fig6))

_<a name="fig6"></a>Figure 6. Adding device or devices to a group_

![AddToGroup](./assets/screenshots/addtogroup.png)

###Filters and search
**EdgeWay Management** allows filtering devices in the list by UUID, a unique device identifier. For that, being in _All devices_, a user may click the ![](./assets/icons/filter.png)_FILTERS_ button in the up-right corner and select UUID from the drop-down list and enter the UUID of the device in the field ([see fig.7](#fig7)).

_<a name="fig7"></a>Figure 7. Filter panel_

![Filter](./assets/screenshots/filter.png)

Also, by clicking tabs in the upper part of the screen, a user may filter (search) devices by the authorization status:

- _Pending_ is a list of devices pending authorization
- _Preauthorized_ is a list of devices that will be authorized immediately after they are turned on
- _Rejected_ is a list of devices that are not anymore allowed to be managed

Two last tabs give additional opportunities to a user:

- _History_ displays a list of devices and allows to see the status change history of each (see [fig. 8](#fig8))
- _New Device_ allows adding a device by its UUID to the list of managed devices.  

_<a name="fig8"></a>Figure 8. Device History_

![History](./assets/screenshots/history.png)

###Information
Every device has multiple properties and data points that are displayed in the **EdgeWay Management** application. In the list, a user can see:

- _UUID_, a unique EdgeWay node identifier (set on the factory),
- _Device Type_, a model of the device,
- _Device Mode_, a field containing the information about the device configuration,
- _Comment_, a comment to the current configuration of the device,
- _Current Software_, a firmware installed on the device,
- _Last Heartbeat_, the date and time of last device activity received by **EdgeWay Management**.

By clicking the device line in the table, a user can open a device information panel. It contains the full information about the device and allows to change some options and device parameters ([see fig. 9](#fig9)).

_<a name="fig9"></a>Figure 9. Device information_

To remove a user or deactivate their account, an administrator should select the appropriate buttons on the page.

# Working Scenarios

## Connecting the Devices

The first device is connected during the signing up and logging in by a tenant administrator. It is impossible to sign up to **EdgeWay Management** without connecting the first device. The device's UUID is present on the device (see on the sticker on the bottom of the device). See details in the chapter [Log in Screen](#log-in-screen).

Other devices may be added in the _Devices_ section. Select the tab _New device_ and enter the device's UUID. If the device is properly registered (in **EdgeWay Registry**), it will be added to the list of the devices.

Generally, the complete process of the device connection looks like this:

1. Purchase [EdgeWay Video device](#ewvideo).
2. Get the UUID of the device (present on the sticker at the bottom of the device).
3. Sign-up to **EdgeWay Management** and specify UUID during the registration process.
4. Power on the EdgeWay Video device.
5. Access the device's local web page and configure it by following the **EdgeWay Video Installation Guide**.
6. See the device's status in **EdgeWay Management**.
7. Add another device by specifying its UUID in the _New device_ tab of the _Devices_ section of the **EdgeWay Management** application.

## Overviewing the IoT Infrastructure

The aggregate of the EdgeWay devices and cameras comprises the [IoT Infrastructure](#iot) of the organization. **EdgeWay Management** allows observing and organizing the devices into the groups, filtering and searching them. See details on organizing devices in the [Devices](#devices) chapter.

[The dashboard](#dashboard) shows the main indicators and charts of IoT Infrastructure, such as Device alarms, Heartbeat summary, Artifacts summary, camera statistics, etc. A user (tenant administrator) starts their work with this summary that allows understanding if everything works perfectly.

Generally, the working scenario looks like this:

1. Log in as tenant administrator or viewer.
2. See the dashboard indicators.
3. If no alarms (Device alarms pie chart is green) and devices are on (Heartbeat summary pie chart is green), there's nothing to bother on. Otherwise, a deeper analysis in the [Devices](#devices) section can help.
4. Go to the _Devices_ and find a required device, see its alarms, configuration, firmware, and other parameters. To find a device, use the groups or filter features. 

## Deploying the Firmware

Tenant administrator may select one of the uploaded [firmware](#firmware) artifacts to deploy over the EdgeWay devices. Firmware deployment is not a frequent procedure and should be performed with a full understanding of the process and consequences.

The steps of firmware deployment are:

1. Log in as tenant administrator.
2. Go to the [Releases](#releases) section.
3. Make sure that the required firmware artifact is on the list.
4. If not, upload it.
5. Go to the [Deployments](#deployments) section.
6. Create a new deployment, specify the required firmware and the list of the devices to deploy the firmware. Another way to apply a deployment is to go to the [Devices](#devices) section, then select a device and apply a deployment to the device in the device information panel. 
7. If there's no required device in the list, add it in the [Devices](#devices) section and start the deployment procedure over again.

## Configuring the Devices

All devices must be properly configured and provided with _configs_ and _flavors_. [The configuration](#configuration) includes various options that, among other things, connects [EdgeWay devices](#device) with **EdgeWay Platform** components such as **EdgeWay Connect**. [Flavor](#flavor) defines the device's feature to start with, it determines the main usage scenario of the device.

When configuring the devices, a tenant administrator should apply one of the existing config and one of the existing flavors to the device or a group of devices.

The general process of applying the configuration is as follows:

1. Log in as tenant administrator.
2. Go to the [Configurations](#configurations) section.
3. Make sure that the required flavor is in the list on the [Flavors](#flavors) tab, and the required config is in the list on the [Configs](#configs) tab.
4. If there's no flavor and/or config that must be applied, create a new one using one of the existing as a template.
5. ***TODO*** Currently there's no way to apply a config/flavor to a device.

## Managing Organization Profile, Users, and Access

**EdgeWay Management** is a multi-tenant and multi-user application. Each [tenant](#tenant) has its private area with its list of [devices](#device), available [firmware artifacts](#firmware), [flavors](#flavor), [configs](#config). 

Each tenant may have more than one user to distribute the access to the [IoT infrastructure](#iot) of the organization over the employees.

The first user, a tenant administrator, will be created during the first [EdgeWay device](#device) connection to the **EdgeWay Management**. This user may create more users of two roles: _Admin_ and _Viewer_. _Admin_ is a tenant administrator with full access to the functions of **EdgeWay Management**.
A viewer is a person with limited read-only access to the information of **EdgeWay Management**.

All user management functions are performed in the [User Management](#user-management) section accessible via the user menu.

The tenant's organization information is available in the [My organization](#my-organization-settings) section accessible via the user menu as well. The tenant's organization identification is set during the [EdgeWay device](#device) purchase process and automatically appears after the first tenant administrator logs in.

# Glossary

<a name="configuration"></a>**Configuration** is a set of options that are given to a [device](#device) and that define its work and behavior.

<a name="device"></a>**Device**, in this document, is a common name for the [EdgeWay Video](#ewvideo) and [EdgeWay Node](#ewnode).

<a name="devicelifecycle"></a>**Device lifecycle status**

<a name="ewvideo"></a>**EdgeWay Video** is the edge device that enables to onboard cameras in an EdgeWay tenant and delivers all the features at the Edge including the compute for AI.

<a name="ewnode"></a>**EdgeWay Node** brings either compute (for AI), bridges, or a mix of both. A pure compute node will just power AI and being fed by a bridge node. The EWN is a hybrid with bridge and computing features. 

<a name="firmware"></a>**Firmware** is low-level software that is installed on the device and allows communicating with the device's hardware components, as well as with the network components and remote software.

<a name="flavor"></a>**Flavor** is a part of the device's configuration that determines the device's feature or features to start with (e.g. RTSP Recorder, Proxy Camera, Liveview, AI extension, EdgeWay Connect solution). Flavor can be delivered to the device or devices in the **EdgeWay Management** application.

<a name="iot"></a>**IoT Infrastructure** (_IoT_ stands for _Internet of Things_) as used in this document is an aggregate of the EdgeWay devices ([EdgeWay Video](#ewvideo) and [EdgeWay Node](#ewnode)) and physical cameras within the organization's perimeter.

<a name="pcam"></a>**Physical Camera** is the real-world device that captures and transmits video to [EdgeWay Video device](#ewvideo).

<a name="slot"></a>**Slot** is an abstract connection point of the [EdgeWay Video device](#ewvideo) for a physical camera found in the LAN.

<a name="tenant"></a>**Tenant** as used in this document is an identity for a customer (organization or other entity) that uses cloud services and applications of **EdgeWay Platform** to manage the isolated [IoT Infrastructure](#iot).

<a name="siem"></a>**SIEM** stands for Security information and event management. **EdgeWay Platform** is SIEM-ready, which means that all application actions are recorded and reported to the secondary interface, a SIEM system. This improves overall security and transparency.  

<a name="token"></a>**Token** is a unique set of characters that need to be set in the device's local settings to confirm that the device belongs to the organization.

<a name="UUID"></a>**UUID** is a unique identifier of a device. UUID may be used to identify physical cameras or virtual cameras, too.

<a name="vcam"></a>**Virtual Camera** is the object that is deployed on an [EdgeWay Connect](#related-documents) and that delivers the EdgeWay service to any IoT back-end.
